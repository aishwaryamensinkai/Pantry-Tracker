## 🏁 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aishwaryamensinkai/Pantry-Tracker.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Pantry-Tracker
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project. Add the following environment variables to the `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_firebase_measurement_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_LLAMA_KEY=your_llama_key
```

Replace the placeholder values (`your_firebase_api_key`, `your_firebase_auth_domain`, etc.) with your actual Firebase and OpenAI credentials.

To set up your Firebase project and obtain these credentials:
i. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
ii. Click on "Add project" or select an existing project
iii. Follow the setup wizard to create your project
iv. Once your project is ready, click on the web icon (`</>`) to add a web app to your project
v. Register your app and Firebase will provide you with the configuration object containing these values

For the LLAMA API key, sign up at the [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) to get your API key.


5. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the project, try the following:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Clear Next.js cache:
```bash
rm -rf .next
```

3. Rebuild the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. For LLAMA API issues, verify that your API key is correctly set in the `.env.local` file and that you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account.
